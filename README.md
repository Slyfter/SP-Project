# SP-Project
This repository represents a Python project for our classes in Scientific Programming at ZHAW SML. 

The goal if this project is to visualize football data from season 21/22 in order to analyze the Forwards of the biggest 5 leagues in europe (Bundesliga (GER), 
La Liga (ESP), Ligue 1 (FRA), Premier League (ENG), Serie A (ITA)).


The project must integrate several topics presented in the module, at a minimum these are the following: 

(done) Use of a real-world dataset (e.g. from Kaggle or other open data sources).

(done) Creation of a GitHub repository with all data, Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, etc.

(done) Use of different data types

(done) Use of built-in datastructures like lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples

(done) Use of one or more pandas data frame(s)

(done) Use of conditional statements, loop control statements and loops

(done) Use of procedural programming or object-oriented programming (one or both).

(done) Use of vizualizations/graphics to present the data


Additional points for the project work if the following is met (max 5 points):

(done) Creativity of implementation (creative is anything which is not part of the lessons and exercises).
(-) Use of Docker
(-) Use of a cloud service (e.g. EC2 instance, Jupyter notebook via Sagemaker).
