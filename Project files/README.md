# SP-Project
This repository represents a Python project for our classes in Scientific Programming at ZHAW SML. 

The goal if this project is to visualize football data from season 21/22 in order to analyze the Forwards of the biggest 5 leagues in europe (Bundesliga (GER), 
La Liga (ESP), Ligue 1 (FRA), Premier League (ENG), Serie A (ITA)).


<b>The project must integrate several topics presented in the module, at a minimum these are the following: <br/><br/></b>
(done) Use of a real-world dataset (e.g. from Kaggle or other open data sources).<br/>
(done) Creation of a GitHub repository with all data, Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, etc.<br/>
(done) Use of different data types<br/>
(done) Use of built-in datastructures like lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples<br/>
(done) Use of one or more pandas data frame(s)<br/>
(done) Use of conditional statements, loop control statements and loops<br/>
(done) Use of procedural programming or object-oriented programming (one or both).<br/>
(done) Use of vizualizations/graphics to present the data<br/>

<br/>

<b>Additional points for the project work if the following is met (max 5 points):</b><br/>

(done) Creativity of implementation (creative is anything which is not part of the lessons and exercises).<br/>
(done) Use of Docker<br/>
